## Project Proposal

A multi-platform social media feature store for easy querying and analysis.

### Overview
Collects streaming data and prepares it for entry into a feature store

This project will pull in multiple streaming sources, store them, and make them available for integrated analysis.

### What will not be included in this project
This project does not currently address the analysis on said social media.
This project may or may not include a visual UI. Even if it does right now, it is conceivable that this would get moved later.
