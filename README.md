Collects streaming data and prepares it for entry into a feature store

This project experiments with pulling in multiple streaming sources, storing them in BigQuery, and making them available for integrated analysis using Feast.

### What will not be included in this project
This project does not currently address the analysis on said social media.
This project may or may not include a visual UI. Even if it does right now, it is conceivable that this would get moved later.
